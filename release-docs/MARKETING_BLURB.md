# Announcing Compression Library v1.1.0 - Record-Breaking Text Compression

We're excited to announce the release of Compression Library v1.1.0, featuring our new Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) algorithm that achieves unprecedented compression ratios for text data.

## üöÄ 50.33% Compression Ratio

Our new BWT implementation compresses text to just over 50% of its original size, outperforming all our existing algorithms. This means you can now store nearly twice as much data in the same space, making it perfect for:

- Text file archiving
- Data backup solutions
- Network transmission optimization
- Embedded systems with limited storage

## üî¨ Technical Excellence

The new BWT algorithm combines several advanced techniques:
- Burrows-Wheeler Transform for context sorting
- Move-To-Front encoding for locality optimization
- Run-Length Encoding for repetition handling
- Huffman coding for entropy compression

## üí° Easy Integration

```cpp
// Just a few lines of code to compress your data
#include <compression/BwtCompressor.hpp>

compression::BwtCompressor compressor;
auto compressed = compressor.compress(data);
auto decompressed = compressor.decompress(compressed);
```

## üìä Benchmark Results

| Algorithm | Compression Ratio | Speed   |
|-----------|------------------|---------|
| BWT       | 50.33%           | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê  |
| Huffman   | 56.77%           | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê |
| LZ77      | 59.80%           | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê   |
| Deflate   | 100.00%          | ‚≠ê‚≠ê    |
